@0    = ~Great Mother! You have frigtened me indeed! DO YOU ALWAYS ACT LIKE GOING ANYWHERE WITHOUT KNOCKING ON A DOOR? AND WHAT ABOUT IF I AM JUST GETTING DRESSED?~
@1    = ~You again! To tell the truth, I have noticed there is something wrong with you, but I am packing up my things right now and will disappear, so "easy come, easy go" like they say...~
@2    = ~Welcome again and gooood-bye for ever! Bye - bye!~

@3    = ~You're obviously here on important business, friends. If you want to see Davaeorn, he's on the fourth floor.~
@4    = ~Alright now... just kidding... Since I was ordered to move here, all I meet are those man-at-arms of Davaeorn, so seeing you is a change for once. For sure you are brought here 'cause he shakes with fear because of some group... I'm sure - whoever they are - they are smart enough to keep far away from these woods. Ya know, druids, spiders, savages, the only thing we miss here are the bearded women and flying rabbits... If you have something to trade, then let's do it, for I'll never finish cleaning these things...~
