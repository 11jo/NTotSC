@0 = ~I have an opportunity for you brave scouts. I can advise you to avoid The Fields of the Dead. It has been a regular dwelling place for orcs and other lost souls for ages, but lately, their number are increasing unexpectedly. Their activities concern even us, and they are constantly trying to kidnap people from around here... My neighbor, Yness, went to Ulgoth's Beard for help, since her husband was the last one to disappear. She must have been there for a week, now. Maybe she never even got there... Well, don't know what your plans look like, but be careful.~
