@0 = ~If you don't mind, I have another quest to offer to you. Near the Firewine Bridge we discovered an entrance to the remaining dungeon part of the city ruins. Unfortunately, there are evil spirits inside, but it shouldn't be too much trouble for you. I want you to go there and clean it out - that would give me the opportunity to begin a new exploration.~
@1    = ~Unfortunately, I have other quests to solve right now. You will need to find someone else.~
@2    = ~Sure, we can take them on, no matter what the 'spirits' are.~
@3    = ~As you wish. I cannot order you to go there, particularly after such a day as this. Good bye!~
@4 = ~Thank you. I have the scroll containing the seal that will allow you to get inside. The entrance is protected by a ward, made by my friend, a mage, to keep out any accidental passers by. You know what I mean, now. So take this scroll, you will be able to pass through the entrance unimpeded.~
