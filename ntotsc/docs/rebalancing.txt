Dungeon under Firewine:
- Changed ntshld02.itm to a +1 shield that gives bonuses to saving throws.
  This was an exact copy of "Pellidan's Shield +2" from Durlag's Tower with
  just a different icon.
- Changed ntbow04.itm to a +1 composite long bow with an extra attack per
  two rounds.  This was an exact copy of "The Dead Shot" from the bandit camp
  with just a different icon.

- Replaced extra copy of ankheg plate with The Black Swan Armor +2 (imported
  from Icewind Dale).
- Removed the Proximity Bomb joke item.

Haeball fight
- nthaebal.cre nerfed again: is now clone of Ramazith with mage script mage4.bcs. Should be detected by SCS this way now.

  Files removed: cloaksc.itm, cloaksc.bam


Officer Tytus fight
- Reduced his impossible THAC0 (0, better than a 20th level fighter, he pretty
  much could not miss, not even counting his girdle) to the appropriate value
  for his level (11, 9th level fighter).
- Replaced his ankheg plate mail with umber hulk plate (imported from IWD).
- Replaced his Girdle of Hill/Stone Giant Strength with the Girdle of Stromnos
  (imported from IWD, like Hill Giant girdle, but with more restrictions)

             ntbelt01 - Girdle of Stromnos


Black Hand Temple
- Cultists' HP and AC adjusted to more level-appropriate values.
- Reduced Draagis' impossibly high HP and AC to more sane levels, made him a
  proper 10th level wizard with appropriate spells.  (He already was a mage,
  but his prepared spells didn't match his mage script.)
- Removed overpowered Namji's Robe, removed Ogi-Luc's Great Robe, gave custom
  Robe of Eyes (true seeing, no backstab).
- number of archers depending on game difficulty. Arrows of piercing removed from most Balck Cultist archers.

  New Items: ntrobe04 - Robe of Eyes


General Ghotal fight
- Reduced ridiculous amount of hit points (625!!) to something sane (150). 
- Reduced ridiculous AC (-11!!) to something sane (-1).

  able to hit back properly.

Tanar'ri in Cloud Peaks AR82PB.are

-fight with Lesser Tanar'ri nerved: number of Lesser Tanar'ri depending in game difficulty
-Invisible Stalkers removed


Crypt AR02PB.are
-monster count in AR02PB reduced depending on game difficulty. For INSANE, all monsters will still be there.
-nerved Knights of the Grave: reduced HP, nerved undroppable flame blade


Miscellaneous changes:
- Few minor code changes, mainly to reduce redundant copying.
- Removed Mummy's Tea item from non-DSotSC game, it serves no purpose
  whatsoever (Elixer of Health does more for less gold, and very few things
  in BG1 cause disease to begin with.)  Thalantyr's shop still gets them in a
  DSotSC game.

  Files removed: adisease.itm, adisease.bam
