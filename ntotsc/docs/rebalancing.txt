Dungeon under Firewine:
- Changed ntshld02.itm to a +1 shield that gives bonuses to saving throws.
  This was an exact copy of "Pellidan's Shield +2" from Durlag's Tower with
  just a different icon.
- Changed ntbow04.itm to a +1 composite long bow with an extra attack per
  two rounds.  This was an exact copy of "The Dead Shot" from the bandit camp
  with just a different icon.


Cave east of Beregost:
- Replaced extra copy of ankheg plate with The Black Swan Armor +2 (imported
  from Icewind Dale).
- Removed the Proximity Bomb joke item.

  New items: ntplat03 - Black Swan Armor +2


Haeball fight
- Reduced his impossible base AC of -6 (which gave him an effective AC of -8,
  fully buffed level 7-9 party could only hit him on a critical) to something
  much more sane: Elven Chain +1 (base AC 4), plus his Cloak of Scintilating
  Colors gives him a much more manageable AC of 2 plus his dexterity bonus.
- Reduced his impossibly high HP (230, more than some BG2 dragons) to a more
  sane value (88).
- Changed class from fighter/druid to fighter/mage as he had only mage spells
  and no druid spells, updated his mage spells to match his level (12/12),
  gave him proper mage script mage10a.
- Made Cloud Kill trap on his desk detectable and removeable.
- Renamed item file of Cloak of Scintilating Colors to ntclck01.itm (and
  ntclck01.bam), removing dependency with DSotSC.

  New items: ntclck01 - Cloak of Scintilating Colors
  Files removed: cloaksc.itm, cloaksc.bam


Officer Tytus fight
- Reduced his impossible THAC0 (0, better than a 20th level fighter, he pretty
  much could not miss, not even counting his girdle) to the appropriate value
  for his level (11, 9th level fighter).
- Replaced his ankheg plate mail with umber hulk plate (imported from IWD).
- Replaced his Girdle of Hill/Stone Giant Strength with the Girdle of Stromnos
  (imported from IWD, like Hill Giant girdle, but with more restrictions)

  New items: ntplat04 - Umber Hulk Plate +1
             ntbelt01 - Girdle of Stromnos


Black Hand Temple
- Cultists' HP and AC adjusted to more level-appropriate values.
- Reduced Draagis' impossibly high HP and AC to more sane levels, made him a
  proper 10th level wizard with appropriate spells.  (He already was a mage,
  but his prepared spells didn't match his mage script.)
- Removed overpowered Namji's Robe, introduced Ogi-Luc's Great Robe (AC 4,
  from Icewind Dale) instead.

  New Items: ntrobe01 - Ogi-Luc's Great Robe


General Ghotal fight
- Reduced ridiculous amount of hit points (625!!) to something sane (150). 
- Reduced ridiculous AC (-11!!) to something sane (-1).
- Set proper THAC0 and APR for 15th level fighter.  He will now actually be
  able to hit back properly.
- Marked him as undead/spectre.
- Gave him a new custom armor.

  New Items: ntplat02 - Ghotal's Plate +2


Miscellaneous changes:
- Few minor code changes, mainly to reduce redundant copying.
- Removed Mummy's Tea item from non-DSotSC game, it serves no purpose
  whatsoever (Elixer of Health does more for less gold, and very few things
  in BG1 cause disease to begin with.)  Thalantyr's shop still gets them in a
  DSotSC game.

  Files removed: adisease.itm, adisease.bam
