/* last addition / changes for v 3.1.0 */

Currently some language versions are not available. This is due to the balancing changes in items and spells, so strings had to be updated. 

Also mod now supports EE engine, so items also need additional version of item descriptions that follows Beamdog formatting: Item descriptions needs to be added to new "setup-EE.tra" file following Beamdog item description style.

All journal entries were moved into the file journal.tra.

The file dsfeydo.tra of NTotSC was renamed to dsfeydo_ntotsc.tra. The original file dsfeydo.tra from DSotSC was added.

Note: The setup-ee.tra file needs to be provided in ANSII format (like all the others).

Following *existing* lines were edited concerning content:

-lobar.tra: removed the "welcome" from @0 
-ntavery.tra: changed wording in line @19 so it's a reply to line @18
-NTINDFIG.tra, @31 : edited the line to make it clearer it contains the name "Haeball"
-NTSILUA.tra: changed the name in @0 to "Syl"
-setup.tra, setup-ee.tra, journal.tra, ntllinde.tra: unified Llindellyn's name to "Llindellyn". Several lines from deprecated items were removed.
