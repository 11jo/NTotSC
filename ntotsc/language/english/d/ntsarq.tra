@0 = ~Hello! And who have we got here?...What a pity, you are not the person... Tell me then, what brings you here?~
@1 = ~An aquaintance forgot something. We were hired to bring it to him. But he never said a word about a Red Mage being in the residence. Satisfy our curiosity - who might you be?~
@2 = ~I have no idea what you are talking about. I came to Baldur's Gate for a reason, but entered the wrong home by mistake. Good bye!~
@3 = ~Ha, ha, the old scamp ran away so fast he forgot his shoes? That's good! It must have been something really valuable since he had to ask anyone to bring it instead of himself... Doesn't matter... I only care about that poor mage. He shouldn't have escaped! The Red Mages do not forget so easily... Enough talking! I feel like venting my anger. And you look like a very handy target! Ha-ha-ha. When we finish, your skulls tell me all I need to know. Ha-ha-ha!~
@4 = ~Not so fast, my dear friends! You'll go nowhere, I think. Wherever I am sent, I leave no traces of my passing! Ha-ha-ha.~
