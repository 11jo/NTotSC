# Northern Tales of the Sword Coast

Northern Tales of the Sword Coast (NTotSC) adds several quests to the BG1 part (with TotSC) to the game. Some are minor encounters with no further impact, but some are larger quests that are also partly connected to each other.

This is a BGT, BG:EE, and EET version of the original mod. For versions 2.0 and higher, NTotSC is no longer dependent on DSotSC. If you want to play the two mods together, install DSotSC first. The versions supported are:

-DSotSC for BGT/EET (version by k4thos)

-[DSotSC for BG:EE](https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/73241/mod-dark-side-of-the-sword-coast-for-bg-ee/p1): version by Red Carnelian.

To reach the new areas via worldmap, you need to install BP-BGT-worldmap for BGT after NTotSC and start a new game. For BG:EE and EET, the worldmap mod is no longer needed but you still need to start a new game to see the mod areas on your worldmap. Thank you to AstroBryGuy for providing the worldmap tweak for BG:EE!
