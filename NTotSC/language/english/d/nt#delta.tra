@0    = ~You have made a wise decision. It is a difficult mission that I give you, but I am sure that you have the wherewithal to make it through. Return and report to me once you feel you have enough information to use against the Iron Throne.
 
There is another case. Our Citadel on the North border seems to have strange things going on. A messenger told me that people were disappearing recently, but I cannot send anyone there who might be loyal. If you are able to spend a few days just visit the place and try to find out what's going on there.~
