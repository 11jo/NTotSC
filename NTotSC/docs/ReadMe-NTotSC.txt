INTRODUCTION
++++++++++++

This is a BGT, BG:EE, and EET version of the original mod. As of version 2.0, NTotSC is no longer dependent on DSotSC. If you want to play the two mods together, install DSotSC first. The versions suppoerted are: 
-DSotSC for BGT/EET version by k4thos
-DSotSC for BG:EE by Red Carnelian

To reach the new areas via worldmap, you need to install BP-BGT-worldmap for BGT and BG:EE after NtotSC an start a new game.

HISTORY
+++++++

One large quest is given to you by Duke Eltan (before you go to Candlekeep).  One of the longest quests also starts before Candlekeep: Talk to the lady outside the Sorceror's Sundries. One quest can be started by talking to Yness in Ulgoth's Beard. The rest can be done during the TotSC quests in Ulgoth's Beard.  

For v2.0, the quests are less restrictive in their order, especially in the order of when to talk to whom. The only restrictions remaining are: The Northern Citadel Quest will be handed out from Duke Eltan when he summons the PC in the original game. The Temple of the Black Hand will only be revealed after the demon in Ulgoth's Beard is defeated. 
All other quests can either be "walked into", received from multiple persons (e.g. "The Field of the Dead"), or received by killing the quest giver instead of going on his fedex quest (e.g. the Ice Slamander or Eldod - they will have the appropriate keys on them.)

INSTALLATION
++++++++++++

It is in Weidu format.  To install, unzip the zip file to your game folder and double-click on Setup-NTotSC.exe.  To uninstall, double-click on Setup-NTotSC.exe again and select the Uninstall option.

The install has six parts: the main component (obligatory for the mod) and five optional componantes of restored game content and Will O'Hara the NPC:

--Keelor the Dwarf
--Pilar and Gheldehar
--Nim Furlwing
--Llindellyn's Lucky Arrow
--Svlast's Torment
--Will O'Hara NPC

DSotSC must also be installed before NTotSC.  This mod also works with BG1NPC.

New:  This version includes a Biff utility.  The biffing will be done automatically at the end of the installation.


WALKTHROUGH
+++++++++++

Shaella
  A really psycho woman inside Blade and Stars wants you to find a book in the Candlekeep crypts. 

Hasdar
  After talking to Shaella, Hasdar will approach you outside of the Blade and Stars. He wants you to find this book Shaella was talking about, and he has some better info on how to find it.

Haeball
  Haeball is a mage in Larswood tower selling magical items. If you killed Hasdar before he could send you on the quest for the book, Haeball will be looking for two items, a Goblin Bow and the Great Book of Unknowing. If you already received the book quest from Hasdar, Haeball will give the quest for the bow if you encountered the Tanar'ri in the Cloud Peaks and made a deal for a peaceful solution. The bow is in some woods north of Baldur's Gate in possession of a Wood Elf. 

Wenric
  Wenric is the farmer near BG that you clear out the zombies for. He will tell you about the Field of the Dead, an orc covered area north of BG.

Winorma or Magnad
  Winorma and Magnad are now in BG because some orcs attacked their caravan. Their children were captured and are now prisoners in the Field of the Dead north of BG.

Yness
  Yness' husband, Pandris, was captured by orcs. He can be found in the Field of the Dead.

Northern Citadel
  Duke Eltan gives you this quest. You need to go north to the citadel and find out what the problems are. After you cleared the Citadel from its problems, there will be a locked altar to investigate.

Avery
  Avery is a monk in the Northern Citadel. He will tell you about the locked altar and where to get the key.

Nadarin
  Nadarin is in Baldur's Gate, but he comes from a fishing village in the north. His village needs help, after that, he can take you with his boat.

Reedrig
  Reedrig is a monk who you free from the orcs in the Fields of the Dead. But that is not all. Talk to him again after clearing the cult in Ulgoth's Beard.

Ogre and Poochy
  An ogre near the docks wants some rat tails for his dog. You will find plenty in the sewers.



SPOILERS
++++++++

The key to the desk next to Haebal can be found in a tree on South Beregost Road (BGT: AR9700;  BG:EE: AR3800, EET: BG3800).

Haebal carries the key needed for the crate in his basement.

The orc crypt requires two keys, a rusty dagger and a ring. Haeball's desk holds the one, Draagis has the other.

The book everyone wants is with the three demons to the south of the Cloudpeaks. No key is needed.

Charles Nib will give you a document that opens a door at the FireWine Bridge.

The altar in the Northern Citadel requires a key given to you from an ice salamander. The Salamander wants Draagis dead.

The magic door in the Field of the Dead will open if you have the Holy Symbol of Helm from the altar.

The area of the Cult of the Black Hand (Draagis) will be revealed by talking to Reedrig in Ulgoth's Beard.

Reedrig will not arrive at the Beard until you have killed the summoned demon in Ulgoth's Beard.

The mod is complete when you have entered the crypts and defeated the orc general.

CREDITS
+++++++

TeamBG for starting all of this.

Hlid, Horred, Seanas, and the others who always help me out.  I need it!

Aurelinus, Hathor, and the wonderful people at Forgotten Isle (http://www.isle.px.pl/index_eng.htm) who made this mod and then translated it to English.  This is their wonderful work.


F.A.Q.
++++++

1.  Yes, version 2.0 is compatible with BGT (Weidu), BG:EE (with or without SoD), and EET. 
    You do not have to have DSotSC installed.

2.  For BGT, you have to have TotSC installed into your BG1 game.

3.  BG1NPC can be installed before or after this mod.  I have fixed this mod so it will now
    work with BG1NPC11 correctly.

4.  Compatibility with SoBH and NTotSC v2.0 will have to be seen but recommendation so far 
    was to install SoBH after DSotSC and NTotSC (they change many areas and files but there
    shouldn't be a conflict).

5.  Because several quests start from Ulgoth's Beard, you have to have TotSC installed
    before installing this mod.  For a BGT-Weidu install, that means it has to be in your
    BG1 game before you install BGT-Weidu.
