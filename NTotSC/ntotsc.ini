# Short description of the mod, main goals, features etc
Description = This mod adds some greater quests and several smaller ones to the BG1 part of the game (BGT, BG:EE, or EET). One large quest is given to you by Duke Eltan (before you go to Candlekeep).  One of the longest quests also starts before Candlekeep: Talk to the lady outside the Sorceror's Sundries. One quest can be started by talking to Yness in Ulgoth's Beard. The rest can be done during the TotSC quests in Ulgoth's Beard. 
Install this mod after DSotSC if you want to install both.
